## Applying Customizations for Specific Websites

To customize a specific website, simply enter your CSS or JS code as usual. Your customizations will be applied only when you visit that website.

## Applying Customizations Globally

If you want your customizations to apply to all websites, use the "All" option. Enter your CSS or JS code, select "All," and click "Apply." Your customizations will be effective on every website you visit.

## CSS Example

Let's say you want to change the font color of all headings on a website. You can enter the following CSS code in the extension:

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #ff9900;
}```

Click "Save," and all headings on that website will now have an orange font color.

## JS Example
Suppose you want to automatically click a specific button on a website. You can enter the following JS code in the extension:

```javascript
document.querySelector('#myButton').click();```

Click "Apply," and the button with the ID "myButton" will be clicked as soon as you load the page.
